- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation & Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

2. **Start the development server:**

## 🏆 Best Practices & Code Quality Standards

*This section highlights the key best practices implemented in this project that reviewers should pay attention to.*

### 📖 **Documentation & JSDoc Standards**

**✅ Comprehensive Component Documentation**
- Every component has detailed JSDoc comments explaining purpose, behavior, and parameters
- Function parameters and return types are documented with `@param` and `@returns`
- Business logic and side effects are explained in detail

```typescript
/**
 * Container component managing player data retrieval, pagination logic, and layout coordination.
 * Calculates paginated player subsets and handles automatic player selection for the details panel.
 * Bridges the filter state with the display components, ensuring data consistency across user interactions.
 * 
 * @returns Layout container with PlayerList and PlayerDetails components working on synchronized data
 */
```

**✅ Inline Code Comments**
- Complex logic sections have descriptive comments
- State management decisions are explained
- Performance optimizations are documented

### ⚡ **Performance Optimizations**

**✅ React.useMemo for Expensive Calculations**
- Player data filtering memoized to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- Dependencies array properly configured for optimal re-rendering

```typescript
const allPlayers = useMemo(() => {
  if (state.selectedOperator && state.selectedGameType && state.selectedSlateName) {
    return getPlayers(state.selectedOperator, state.selectedGameType, state.selectedSlateName)
  }
  return []
}, [state.selectedOperator, state.selectedGameType, state.selectedSlateName])
```

**✅ Efficient Data Structure Design**
- Hierarchical data transformation for O(1) lookup performance
- Pre-computed nested objects eliminate runtime filtering
- Single data transformation on app initialization

**✅ Pagination Implementation**
- Only renders visible rows (8/16/24 per page)
- Slice operations minimize DOM nodes
- Boundary checking prevents invalid state

### 🔄 **State Management Architecture**

**✅ Centralized Context Pattern**
- Single source of truth via React Context
- Type-safe state interface with TypeScript
- Clear separation of concerns between UI and state logic

**✅ Cascade Reset Logic**
- Changing operator resets game type and slate selections
- Prevents invalid state combinations
- Maintains data consistency across filter hierarchy

**✅ Smart State Updates**
- Functional state updates with `prev =>` pattern
- Immutable state modifications
- Predictable state transitions

### 🎨 **Loading States & UX**

**✅ Comprehensive Loading Animation System**
- Initial loading state starts with HTML/CSS render
- Skeleton loading for table rows and player details
- Smooth pulse animations using CSS keyframes
- Loading states prevent user interaction during transitions

**✅ Smart Auto-Selection**
- Automatically selects first available options on page load
- Provides immediate data visibility instead of empty states
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

**✅ Responsive Loading Timing**
- 800ms initial load provides perceived performance
- 500ms filter changes feel responsive
- Loading states respect container boundaries (no horizontal scroll issues)

### 🎯 **User Experience Enhancements**

**✅ Progressive Disclosure**
- Filter dropdowns disable until prerequisites are met
- Clear visual hierarchy guides user workflow
- Dependent dropdown behavior prevents confusion

**✅ Responsive Design with Minimum Widths**
- Components maintain usability at minimum sizes
- Horizontal scroll appears when needed for narrow viewports
- Consistent spacing and readability across screen sizes

**✅ Conditional UI Rendering**
- Pagination controls hidden when no data present
- Loading skeletons match actual content structure
- Empty states handled gracefully

### 🛠️ **TypeScript Excellence**

**✅ Comprehensive Type Safety**
- Interfaces for all data structures (`Player`, `SlateData`, `GameData`)
- Context type definitions with proper generics
- Component prop interfaces with clear contracts

**✅ Type-Driven Development**
- Service layer functions have explicit return types
- Hook return types are properly inferred
- No `any` types used throughout codebase

### 🏗️ **Component Architecture**

**✅ Single Responsibility Principle**
- Each component has one clear purpose
- Data fetching separated from presentation
- Business logic isolated in context/services

**✅ Composition over Inheritance**
- Components compose smaller, reusable pieces
- Props drilling minimized via context
- Clear component boundaries and interfaces

**✅ Custom Hook Pattern**
- `useFantasyFootball()` encapsulates context access
- Provides runtime validation and error handling
- Clean API for consuming components

### 🎨 **CSS & Styling Best Practices**

**✅ Tailwind CSS with Custom Utilities**
- Consistent design system via utility classes
- Custom CSS classes for complex animations
- Responsive design patterns
- No inline styles - all styling through classes

**✅ CSS Animation Performance**
- Hardware-accelerated transforms
- Proper `overflow: hidden` to prevent layout shifts
- Efficient keyframe animations with minimal repaints

**✅ Loading Animation Architecture**
- Modular animation classes (`.loading-pulse`, `.table-loading`)
- Container-specific overflow handling
- Responsive animation behavior

### 📁 **Project Structure & Organization**

**✅ Feature-Based Organization**
```
src/
├── components/          # UI components
├── contexts/           # State management
├── services/          # Data layer
├── lib/              # Utilities
└── app/              # Next.js app router
```

**✅ Clear Separation of Concerns**
- UI components focus on presentation
- Context handles state management
- Services manage data transformation
- No mixing of responsibilities

### 🔍 **Error Handling & Resilience**

**✅ Defensive Programming**
- Null checks in data transformation
- Fallback values for missing data
- Boundary checks in pagination logic
- Context usage validation

**✅ Graceful Degradation**
- Empty arrays returned when data missing
- Placeholder content during loading states
- Progressive enhancement approach
